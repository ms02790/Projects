# Credit Card Fraud Detection
The main objectives in this project is the detection of credit card fraud. This can be seen as a classification problem and tackled using machine learning techniques. Mainly, four Machine Learning algorithms – Decision Tree, SVM, Naïve Bayes and MLP are used to train and predict classes for the testing data. The results obtained from both are then analyzed and compared to determine which model works best on each dataset. Different evaluation metrics as well as visualizations are used for this.
