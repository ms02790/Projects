Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
### Employee Attrition
The main objective of this project is to predict the employee attrition and the factors contributing to it. Using the data, the patterns and relationships are illustrated. Following the CRISP-DM methedology, the model pipeline is developed and predictions are evaluated. The models used are: SVM, Random Forest and Naive Bayes.
### Credit Card Fraud Detection
The main objectives in this project is the detection of credit card fraud. This can be seen as a classification problem and tackled using machine learning techniques. Mainly, four Machine Learning algorithms – Decision Tree, SVM, Naïve Bayes and MLP are used to train and predict classes for the testing data. The results obtained from both are then analyzed and compared to determine which model works best on each dataset. Different evaluation metrics as well as visualizations are used for this.
### Cloud Computing
A basic cloud-based application that uses multiple cloud services to determine the risks of using certain trading signals for a trading strategy using Monte Carlo simulation. The system is developed using two scalable services, namely, AWS Lambda and EC2 and deployed using Google App Engine. It provides user to be able to provision computing resources with rapid elasticity. The framework provides a persistent front end for user to initialize and terminate resources and receive information as output about the risks estimated. It also explores the cost of running the services as per user’s demand. Lastly, a screenshot of a sample test run with the results and the cost of running for each service is shown.
